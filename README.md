# marionext-lodash

Simply a lightweight version of lodash/underscore, rewritten in typescript and without all the methods that are already included in es6 (all iterations over object/array), following [You don't (may not) need Lodash/Underscore](https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Lodash-Underscore).

__Most of the code is just an adaptation/rewrite from [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) in typescript__
